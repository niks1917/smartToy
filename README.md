PlayTo is an educational product for yound children that uses AI to convert STEM toy manuals into an enquiry based learning opportunity. In the below demo, the app is prompted to guide a child through the process of making a bluetooth speaker, with the learning goal being to teach elecrical circuits and their uses 

In the below image: 
- Left hand side is the child app with fun playful pandas for the child to 'bop' in the tummy to start chatting with. The child interacts with the pandas only via voice chat
- Right hand side is the parent monitoring screen with a live transcription of the child's chat with the AI pandas (<5 second lag)
- An additional feature for parents is the 'Tip to help your child' which takes the current context of the chat with the child, summarizes it, and prompts the parents with the best socratic guidance to provide at this point in the child's learning journey
