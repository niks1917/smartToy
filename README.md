# smartToy
PlayTo is an educational product for young children that convert STEM toy manuals into an enquiry based learning opportunity. In the below demo, the app guides a child through the process of making a bluetooth speaker, teaching the child about elecrical circuits and their uses

In the below image: 
- On the left hand side is the child app with fun playful pandas for the child to 'bop' in the tummy to start chatting with. The child interacts with the pandas only via voice chat
- On the right hand side is a parent monitoring screen with a live transcription of the child's chat with the AI pandas (<5 second lag)
- An additional feature for parents is the 'Tip to help your child' which takes the current context of the chat with the child, summarizes it, and prompts the parents with the best socratic guidance to provide at this point in the child's learning journey
